# README-Generator

## Description
A template to create a quality README.md file for future projects to save time by entering info via questions using command terminal/node to quickly enter info and create. Uses JavaScript, ES6, (let, const, arrow functions, template literals, inquirer, fs.writeFile).

## Installation
Feel free to git clone to your local to use.

You'll need to run npm install inquirer. NPM fs is already a part of core Node.js so no need to install, just make sure to 'require'.

To start, run node index.js in your terminal/command line. Answer the prompts to generate the content of the README. Make sure not to typo your GitHub username and email. After you've answered all the questions, your new README file will be created and will be waitin in your repo.
